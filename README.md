# API_Automation-On-Crypto-Website

This project was initiated to analyze the growth of various cryptocurrencies over a particular time by making an API call to the Crypto website for the data.
The process is stored in a function and finally automated to make a call every 24hours for 7 days.
The final result is stored in a CSV file which will be eventually used for visualization after exploration and cleaning.

However, this is a work in progress, measures will be added as time goes by
